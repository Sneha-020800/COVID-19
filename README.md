# COVID-19
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes the spread and impact of COVID-19 using Python in Jupyter Notebook.
The aim was to clean, analyze, and visualize COVID-19 data to gain insights into confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, and trends across different Indian states and Union Territories.

The project demonstrates the complete Data Science pipeline:

Data cleaning

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualizations (scatter plots, heatmaps, choropleth maps, bar charts, bubble maps)

Insights & conclusions

ðŸ“‚ Features Implemented

âœ… Data Cleaning â€“ Removed irrelevant columns, calculated active cases, handled missing values.
âœ… EDA with Pandas â€“ Summaries, formatting, background colors to highlight hotspots.
âœ… Visualization â€“

Scatter plots (state-wise cases)

Heatmap of states & case severity

Choropleth map of India (state-level cases)

Bubble maps for hotspots

Bar chart of top states

Subplots for comparison

âœ… Insights & Conclusions â€“ Highlighted states with maximum cases, recovery patterns, and critical trends.

ðŸ“Š Insights Gained

Maharashtra and Kerala emerged as major hotspots.

Delhi, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana formed the second tier of concern.

Several states had relatively lower impact but still required monitoring.

Clear trends of recovery vs. active vs. death cases were observed over time.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ Data visualization

Plotly â€“ Interactive visualizations

Folium â€“ Choropleth and bubble maps

Jupyter Notebook â€“ DevelopmentÂ environment
